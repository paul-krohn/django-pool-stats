## Scoring your match

First and foremost, this system does not replace paper score sheets, which should be considered authoritative for each match.

If there are any new players joining your team, let the league know as soon as possible so they can be added to the site.

Find the list of matches for this week in the Weeks menu. Click the "New Scoresheet" link, and "Yes" to confirm you want to create one.
You will be able to edit this score sheet as long as you keep the browser window you started it in open.

Click the "Lineups and Subs" button, which reveals the links for setting the home and away starting lineups. Once you have done that,
you can set the substitutions. Double-check that the expected names show up for each game.

You can mark each game as it is played, and save whenever you like, or wait until the match is complete.

Once the match is complete, click the "Review and Comment" button. This will show the team and individual results for the match; this is a good time to verify forfeits and table runs.

Click the "Complete" button, add a comment if you like, and click Save. You are done! If there is any question about any aspect of scoring the match, take a picture of it and mail it to the league stats person.
