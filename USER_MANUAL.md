### Starting a new season ###

All in the admin interface:

1. Unset 'is default' on the previous season.
1. Create a new season. Don't set `is_default`.
1. From season list view, select one season, then the "Set default season" action.
1. Create the divisions for the new season. Note: when creating teams, the divisions in the select menu will be for whatever is currently the season with 'is_default' set.
1. Create the weeks.
1. Create the teams. Note: you can copy and modify teams from a previous season, if they are similar enough for that to be quicker than creating them from scratch.
1. Create the matches. You're done! You have a new season.

### Managing results ###

1. Navigate to the Score Sheets section of the admin UI.
1. Filter on the season, and on Official set to No; you should now see a list of submitted score sheets. Users should have marked their score sheets as complete, but may not have.
1. Select some or all of the filtered score sheets, and select the "Lint score sheets" action. This will flag which score sheets have clear errors, like the wrong number of wins.
1. Under the Links column, there is a link to the public edit and view versions of each score sheet. Use these to decide which version of a match is correct, make fixes, etc.
1. Mark each score sheet that is correct as 'official'. 
1. Delete the score sheets that are redundant/incomplete.
1. To update the stats and expire caches, select one score sheet or one season, and select the "Update stats" action.
1. You are done!
